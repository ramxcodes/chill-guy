# Chill Guy frontend

This is a fun web app that roasts GitHub users based on their username. Simply enter any GitHub username, and the app fetches a custom roast for that username! Built using React and integrated with a backend API to generate the roasts, this website adds a touch of humor to the otherwise serious world of GitHub.
